Welcome to Python Simple Workflow
=================================

Under heavy development, and not yet usable

python-simple-workflow is a wrapper for `Amazon Simple Workflow <http://aws.amazon.com/swf>`_ service. It aims to provide some abstractions over `Boto <http://boto.readthedocs.org>`_ library SWF API implementation, like querysets and objects over commonly used concepts: ``Domains``, ``Workflows``, ``Activities``, and so on.

It is under MIT license, and any ideas, features requests, patches, pull requests to improve it are of course welcome.
